==== SELENIUM REVIEW ====

* what is test automation and what are the benefits?
	- no human interaction
	- fast
	- reliable
	- scalable
	- data driven testing

* what can be automated?
	- Something stable
	- Smoke / sanity test
    - functional test
    - Test data creating
    - API
    - Database

* what Test case should be automated?
    - must be stable test case
    - should be repetitive, can be used more than once
    - should not need any human interaction
    - should have a value, High ROI

* What are the common test automation tools?
    - Watir, selenium, UFT

* What is SELENIUM?
    - selenium is a tool that automates browser, it is used 
    for testing

* Advantages of selenium?
    - Open source
    - interact with web application
    - supports multiple browsers, operating systems
    - supports different languages
    - reusability
    - community

* Disadvantage of Selenium?
    - it only supports web applications
    - no official support / no help desk
    - can not work with graphics, capchas, bar codes, shapes
    - no built in reporting tool
    - hard to master requires develoepr level knowledge
    - hard to write good locators
    - hard to synchronize

* what we dont do in selenium?
    - performance, load, stress testing, manual, ad hoc testing
    usability pure database testing (if we only test the db it self)
    , unit tests.. we dont do it. look and feel based testing
    color shapes static testing.
    
* what is a locator in selenium?
    - in selenium locator is a means of finding a element in html
        - ID
        - name
        - css
        - Xpath
        - tagName
        - className
        - linkText
        - partialLinkText
* what is xpath?
    - is one of the locators in selenium 

* what is difference between Absolute and Relative Xpath?
    - Absolute:
        - Starts with /, starts looking from the root
        element of the html document
    - Relative:
        - Starts with // looks for element in any part of 
        the page

* which situations are you going to use Xpath?
    - when we can not use unique information such as ID, name, 
    tags, class ..
    - when dealing with dynamic elements: id changes every time
    we can use contains, starts-with, ends-with
    - when we deal with indexes 
    - when we search by text: //span[.= 'submit']
    - when tables xpath can handle parents child sibling

* how do you choose locators?(whats the best locator)
    - it depends on the situation on the web site, on the application
    - If there is ID on web site yes, if no ID then Name,
    - if it is a link:
                    - linktext
                    - partiallinktext
                    - then others
    - if its not a link:
                    - Id
                    - name
                    - tagname
                    - class
                    - css : easy to read and write, fast 
                    - Xpath

* css vs Xpath?
    - css: 
        - fast easy to read and write, should be used if both 
        cdd and xpath are options.
    - Xpath:
        - works with text
    
* what is implicit wait / explicit wait?
    - Implicit wait:
                - Syntax: driver.manage.timeouts.implicitlyWait(5)
                - set once always works if it doesnt find element
                it will wait for 5 seconds otherwise it complains
                applies every time when findelement/s method runs
                - The implicit wait will tell to the web driver to 
                wait for certain amount of time before it throws a 
                "No Such Element Exception".

    - Explicit wait:
                - sometimes we need to wait for certain event
                such as element is visible, clickable, enabled..
                - WebDriverWait,
                - ExpectedConditions
    - FluentWait:   
                - is also a type of explicit wait. Using fluent wait
                wecan customize the webDriverWait

* what is difference between Assert and Verify?
    - Assert:
            -  if it fails test execution stops

    - Verify:
            - verify if it fails you make a note and continue with 
            the test

* whats difference between QUIT and CLOSE?
    - Quit:
        - closes the windows
    
    - Close:
        - closes the current tab/window 

* how selenium handles drop downs?
    - select class is used to deal with drop down list in selenium.
    to create a select object we need to pass a webElement as 
    constructor. that element must have the select tag
    - select by Index: Takes a int param, selects based on the index
    0 based.
    - select by visible text: takes a string, select based on the 
    text displayed.
    - select by value: takes a string parameter selects based on
    the value attribute of the option 

* how to check the multiple selected value in dropdown?
    - select carsList = new Select(el)
    - carList.getSelectedOption(): returns the selected option
    a list(List<WebElement>)
    - carList.getFirstSelectedOption  <- method that returns
    the selected option(the webElement)
    - asserEquals("Wooden Spoon", carList.getFirstSelectedOption().getText())

* how do you verify all options in dropdown?
    - Select stateList = new Select(el)
    - stateList.getOptions(): returns all the available options
    selected or not

* how to work with dropdown without the select tag?
    - if they dropdown list has no select tag we can not use the
    select class
    - thread the dropdown list and its options as separate 
    elements locate every element separately
    - the select an option: 1 find and click 

* What is the syntax for switching frame?
    - its html page inside html page / we have to treat them as 
    different pages.
    - Iframe/frame : tags for frames. Frame is a html document
    inside another html document.
    - Web driver handles one page at a time to control another frame
    we always need to switch
    - driver.switchTo.frame() : takes webElement -> find the iframe 
    and pass it as a param. 
    - driver.switchTo.frame() : takes String -> find the id or
    name of the iframe and pass as param
    - driver.switchTo.frame() : takes int -> find the index and pass
    as param

* what is the syntax for switching windows?
    - to handle separate tabs/ windows we have to switch 
    to that tab
    - web driver handles one page html document at a time. to
    control another tab we always need to switch
    - to be able to switch we need to get the window handle first
    using getWindowHandesl() method
    - driver.switchTo.window() : takes a string -> window handle
    - for each : driverGetWindowHandles:
        driver.switchTo.window("title")
        if driver.getTitle == expected title
            break;
    - selenium needs the windows handle to switch tabs it doesn not
    use the title. to switch using title we still switch using the 
    window handle first then check the title.

* What operations can you do using actions class?
    - Actions class lets us do advanced mouse and keyboard 
    operations.
    - Hover over element / move to element 
    - scroll up/down
    - double click
    - right click
    - drag and drop
    - keyboard conbinations

* what is the syntax for double click actions?
    - perform any actions against an web element using actions class
    we need to locate the element first
        WebElement el = driver.findElement
        Actions actions = new Actions(driver)
        actions.doubleClick(el);

        actions.moveTO(el)
        actions.doubleClick

* what is the syntax for uploading a file?
    - in order to upload file using selenium  we need to locate
    the upload button in html. the element will have tag
    input then we do sendKeys by passing the path to file
    which 
        WebElement upload = driver.findElement
        upload.sendKeys("C:/user/me/file.txt")
* sometimes sendKeys path does not work
    - you have to use the robot or autoid
    - to fix you have to build a dynamic path for file inside
    our project
    - path of the file in the project : 
    String projectDir= System.getProperty("usr.dir")
    path of the file in the project : 
    "src/test/resources/test_data/myfile.txt"
    - Element.sendKyes(projectDir+file)
* have you done any cross browser testing?
    - yes
    - always mention that you have a control file for keywords
    like browserType main url password username enviroment. 

* have you done any headless browser testing?
    - its a browser that does not open it runs as a background service
    or program. They are fast
    - html unitdriver: headless browser that comes from selenium
        webdriver driver = new hemlUnitDRiver();
    - phanthomjsDriver: thrid party driver
        webdriver driver = new htmlUnitDriver();
    - taking screenshots will still work with headless browser
